# MONOPOLYO

## Description

MONOPOLYO was created to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Martial Law in the Philippines. A game, a dialogue, a provocation, the zine maps out the Marcoses’ ill-gotten wealth in New York through a game of monopoly. 

The webzine takes on the POV of Marcos to show the frivolity and sheer ridiculousness of not only the theft he committed but also his refusal to repent for his sins to the public. Rolling the dice points to words and phrases, instead of numbers, to open up conversations and reflections on Martial Law, overriding the myth-making his family continues to propagate to erase the atrocities they have done to the Philippine republic.

This interactive zine was co-developed by E.L. Guerrero and Czyka Tumaliuan to commemorate the 50th Anniversary of Martial Law at Printed Matter’s New York Art Book Fair 2022.
